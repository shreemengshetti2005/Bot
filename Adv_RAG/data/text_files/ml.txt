Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance on tasks without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following fixed instructions, ML algorithms identify patterns and make predictions or decisions based on input data.

There are three main types of ML:

Supervised Learning – The model learns from labeled data (e.g., predicting house prices based on features like size and location).

Unsupervised Learning – The model finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., customer segmentation).

Reinforcement Learning – The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties (e.g., training robots or game AI).

ML is widely used in applications like recommendation systems, voice assistants, fraud detection, self-driving cars, and medical diagnosis.
